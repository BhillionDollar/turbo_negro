# 🕶️ **Turbo Negro**  
*A Bhillion Dollar Game — From New Orleans to the World.*

---

## ⚡ Overview
**Turbo Negro** is a Southern Gothic, New Orleans-born side-scrolling fighter built entirely on the **Bhillion Dollar Stack** — a full-stack creative ecosystem engineered by **Bhil / Bhillion Dollar Productions**.

This isn’t just a game.  
It’s a proof of concept that one artist can build a complete studio-grade system — from code, to soundtrack, to analytics — and release it straight to the world.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay
A 2D fighter with deep rhythm and atmosphere:
- Play as **Turbo Negro** or **Re Re Marie** — two sides of a Southern Gothic legend.  
- Explore New Orleans-inspired environments filled with symbolism, soul, and supernatural conflict.  
- Battle **Mardi Gras Zombies** and other foes using fluid combat, projectile physics, and environmental dynamics.  
- Earn points, collect health, and survive long enough to uncover the deeper truth.

Built in **Phaser 3**, every frame, hitbox, and particle effect runs on hand-tuned logic within the Bhillion Dollar Game Engine.

## 🧠 Development Philosophy
> *Art first — the infrastructure supports and protects the movement.*

Turbo Negro isn’t a clone of industry formulas — it’s a live prototype of independence.  
Every system (download logic, analytics, payment, email capture, and signed URLs) is part of the Bhillion Dollar Stack — proving that direct-to-fan artistry and ownership can scale globally.
